This only adresses the maxpat file. If you just want to use OHM2Resolume you should open the collective (mxf-file).

put the "OHM64 Externals" folder into 
on Windows: Program Files\Cycling '74\max 5.0\Cycling '74\
on OS X: Applications\MAX5\Cycling '74\

if you already have JASCH Objects installed you want to delete the files below from the folder "OHM64 Externals".

on Windows:
_.mxe
idx.mxe
toxine.mxe

on OS X:
_.mxo
idx.mxo
toxine.mxo
