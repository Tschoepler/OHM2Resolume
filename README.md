OHM2Resolume
============

OHM2Resolume is a MAX project to make Livid's MIDI-controller OHM64 talk to Resolume's VJ-application Avenue and vice verca. I was tired of not getting any LED-Feedback on my MIDI-Controller when performing in a usually dark surrounding called club. So I started with some basic XML-parsing and added on top of it to get more complex control over the software.
