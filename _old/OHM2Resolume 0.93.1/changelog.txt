OHM2Resolume v0.93.1

New: Added fine grained +/- BPM control on "10/Shift/Button5â€“8"
New: Last opened composition is selected in drop-down menu after startup

Fixed: A resync pauses blinking of the buttons
Fixed: Sometimes MIDI out needs to be set again after opening OHM2Resolume to make the patch send MIDI/OSC
Fixed: OHM2Resolume resets BPM of Arena on startup. Should be the other way around.

Change: MAX 7.1 compatible
Change: Replaced a couple of 3rd party objects with objects that already ship with MAX/MSP
Change: Cleaned up the sequencer GUI a little
Change: BPM non editable from OHM2Resolume anymore. Everything is synced via OSC from Arena as master.
