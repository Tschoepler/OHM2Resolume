v0.89a

Bug­fix: with new MAX 6 ver­sion column change led to stack overflow
Lots of minor bugfixes
Impro­ve­ments under the hood
But­tons now blink twice as fast, this way it’s easier to fol­low when trig­ge­ring real fast ;] (I’ll imple­ment an inter­face for that soon)
MIDI sequen­cer is now fully quan­ti­zed and lis­tens to Resync
MIDI sequen­cer cat­ches MIDI input even if the first button/note is trig­ge­red slightly too soon
MIDI sequen­cer used to record only till the last note played. Now it records the full length you set it to. Wea­t­her you’re trig­ge­ring real hard or it’s just a note in the beginning.
BPM and Resync are now bidi­rec­tio­nal: Set the BPM or Resync in eit­her Reso­lume or the OHM2Resolume.
Click Pause in Reso­lume and the patch will stop its metro­nome thus the but­tons stop blin­king indi­ca­ting Reso­lume is on hold.
